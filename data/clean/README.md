# Final Project

I downloaded the IMDB 5000 Movies Dataset from Kaggle. 
Internet Movie Databse is the most important movie database and it is consulted by millions of people around the world. 
The dataset records data about 5000 movies on IMBD, from 1916 to 2016 and from various countries.  
The clean dataset has 3834 observations out of 27 variables.
